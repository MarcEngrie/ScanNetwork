ScanNetwork is a Python script that

  1: scans your network (based on interface IP and netmask on which the script runs) for devices that are alive -> IP, MAC address and DNS name

  2: scans your network looking the availability of an extended range of mDNS services

  3: scans the devices that are alive on your network for open ports (this can take a vry very very long time to finish)

  This was written and tested on a Windows (11) machine. It should run also on Linux machines not tested yet.
